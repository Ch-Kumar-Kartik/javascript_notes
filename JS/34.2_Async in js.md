JavaScript Event Loop

JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it executes one task at a time. The event loop manages asynchronous operations by handling two types of queues:

Macrotask Queue: Includes tasks like setTimeout, setInterval, and I/O operations. These tasks are executed one at a time in the order they’re scheduled.

Microtask Queue: Includes promise callbacks (like .then(), .catch(), .finally()) and other high-priority tasks. Microtasks are executed after the current synchronous code and before the next macrotask.
